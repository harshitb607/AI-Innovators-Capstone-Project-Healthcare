Peer Assessment

For this project, I was assigned to a group, but I was ultimately the only person who actively participated and completed the work. I reached out to my teammates multiple times, but I did not receive responses or contributions from them. Because of this, there were no opportunities for collaboration, sharing tasks, or dividing responsibilities.

Since I worked alone, I handled all aspects of the project myself — including the concept development, design work, README documentation, mockups, slides, and the final pitch video. Although the situation was not ideal, I tried to maintain the team structure by documenting everything clearly and ensuring the project met all requirements.

Because my teammates did not engage in the project, I am unable to provide traditional peer feedback on their contributions, communication, or teamwork.
