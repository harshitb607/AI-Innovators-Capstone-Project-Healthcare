Group Charter:
As of 5:00 PM on November 4, 2025, Canvas lists three members in the group:

Glorie Mugunga
Yvonne Meugang Kemgo
Harshit Barhay (myself)

Earlier, Bryn Nobles was shown as a member of this team, but is no longer listed on Canvas.
I have been actively trying to contact Yvonne and Glorie, but have not received any responses so far. 
Additionally, I was unable to locate Glorie’s email address on either Outlook or Canvas.
In the meantime, I have created this GitHub repository and added preliminary project materials to ensure that our team shows progress for the first check-in. 
Once communication with the other members is established or the professor provides clarification, group roles and responsibilities will be finalized.

Proposed Roles (pending team confirmation):

Project Manager / Interim Coordinator: Harshit Barhay
AI Design / Development: To be assigned
Research & Ethics: To be assigned
