AI Innovators Project – MedQuery AI

Domain: Healthcare & Wellness
Proposed by: Harshit Barhay

Problem Statement:
Doctors spend a significant portion of their time retrieving and managing patient data from electronic health record systems. This causes administrative burden, reduced patient time, and higher stress levels.

Concept Overview:
MedQuery AI is an intelligent assistant that enables doctors to retrieve patient data and reports using natural voice or text queries. The AI understands commands like “Show me Mr. X’s ECG from 2021” or “Compare his cholesterol results between 2020–2023”, accesses the database securely, and displays the results in an easy-to-read format.

AI Application:
1. Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for query understanding.
2. Applies Information Retrieval to access structured/unstructured hospital data.
3. Model trained on simulated EHR datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III).
4. Designed for workflow enhancement, not diagnosis.

Ethical & Security Considerations:
1. No medical decision-making.
2. HIPAA-compliant handling of patient data (anonymized).
3. Transparent data sourcing and access permissions.

Next Steps:
1. Finalize group roles and collaboration.
2. Build a simple mockup interface (text-based or visual).
3. Expand README to include ethics, data plan, and architecture diagram.
