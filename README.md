##MedSight AI: Clinical Decision-Support Assistant
##Product Description:

MedSight AI is an intelligent clinical decision-support assistant designed to help doctors make safer, faster, and more informed medical decisions. The system analyzes patient symptoms, medical history, and clinical notes to generate insights, diagnostic suggestions, alerts, and structured summaries — all while keeping the physician fully in control.
MedSight AI focuses on enhancing decision-making, not replacing the clinician.

Note: Other assigned team members did not participate or respond to communication. All work submitted in this repository (slides, README, mockups, logo, pitch video, and documentation) was completed independently.

##AI Method & Data Plan:

MedSight AI uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract key symptoms, medical terms, and patterns from patient notes and histories.
A medical knowledge-graph-based reasoning layer is used to map extracted symptoms to potential diagnoses and clinical concerns. The model focuses on:

Symptom extraction

Risk-flagging and alerts

Diagnosis suggestion lists

Structured clinical summaries

Training data would include de-identified medical notes, symptom-term mappings, and validated medical ontology resources (e.g., SNOMED, ICD-10).
The system is built to remain explainable, transparent, and fully under physician supervision.

##Problem:

Clinicians are overwhelmed with high patient loads, administrative work, and increasingly complex medical information. This results in longer decision times, greater cognitive load, potential oversight, and increased burnout. Doctors need tools that summarize information and highlight risks quickly and accurately.

##AI Solution:

MedSight AI processes unstructured medical text using NLP to identify medically relevant patterns, highlight concerns, and provide real-time insights. The assistant offers suggested diagnoses, symptom summaries, and alerts, all visible through a clean dashboard interface.
Clinicians always verify or reject AI suggestions, ensuring full human control.

##Market & User Fit:

MedSight AI is designed for:

Hospitals looking to reduce documentation time

Clinics aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy

Telehealth platforms that need faster, automated summaries

Independent practices needing decision-support without hiring additional staff

The tool provides value by improving efficiency, reducing administrative burden, and assisting clinicians with complex decision-making.

##Ethical Considerations:

MedSight AI follows a responsible AI framework with emphasis on transparency, safety, and privacy. All AI suggestions require physician confirmation to prevent automated misdiagnosis. The system offers explainable outputs so clinicians can understand how each suggestion was generated. Patient data is handled under HIPAA-compliant practices, and the model undergoes continuous monitoring for bias, accuracy drift, and fairness across patient groups.
