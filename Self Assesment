Self-Assessment Reflection

My main contribution to this project was doing everything myself since my teammates were not active. I created the idea for MedSight AI, wrote the descriptions, made the logo and mockup, designed the slides, updated the README, and recorded the pitch video. I basically handled the full project from start to finish.

The AI concept I learned the most about was how NLP can be used to read and understand text, especially in medical settings. Learning how AI pulls out symptoms, patterns, and key information from a doctor’s notes is something I can definitely use in future projects, especially in engineering or data-related work.

Since I worked alone, collaboration was limited. I had to make all the decisions myself, but I still tried to follow the ethical guidelines we learned — focusing on transparency, privacy, and making sure the AI supports the doctor instead of replacing them.

If I had more time or resources, I would try to build a small working demo to show how the system would actually process real patient information. I’d also get feedback from real users to improve the design. Overall, even though the situation with the group wasn’t ideal, I learned a lot by doing the entire project on my own.
