Problem Definition – MedQuery AI

Problem Statement:
Doctors and healthcare professionals spend a significant portion of their time navigating complex electronic health record (EHR) systems to retrieve patient information. 
This repetitive process leads to administrative fatigue, reduced time for direct patient interaction, and increased risk of oversight during consultations.

Product Concept:
MedQuery AI is an intelligent assistant that allows doctors to retrieve patient data and reports using natural language commands (text or voice).

Example:

“Show me Mr. X’s ECG from 2021.”
“Summarize John’s last three lab reports.”

The AI processes these requests, accesses the relevant medical files, and returns concise, organized information — securely and quickly — so clinicians can focus more on patient care.

How AI is Applied:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Interprets voice/text queries to understand what data the doctor is requesting.
2. Information Retrieval Algorithms: Searches authorized patient databases for matching records.
3. Summarization Model: (Optional) Briefly summarizes reports using transformer-based text summarization.
4. Training: Supervised fine-tuning on anonymized medical query datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III, synthetic EHRs).
5. Output: Displays retrieved reports and summaries within seconds through a secure interface.

Ethical Considerations:
1. No diagnostic or decision-making capabilities.
2. HIPAA-compliant, secure data handling.
3. Transparent and auditable query logs.
4. Bias-free, neutral language modeling.
