# MedQuery AI – Ethics, Market Fit & User Focus

## 1. Target Market & User Needs

**Primary users:** Physicians, nurses, and clinicians in hospitals and large clinics.  
**Secondary users:** Medical assistants and health information staff who support clinicians.

**User pain points:**

- Time wasted clicking through complex EHR menus to find old reports.
- Cognitive load during busy clinics or emergencies.
- Frustration with slow, non-intuitive search tools.

MedQuery AI aims to reduce search time and friction so clinicians can spend more time with patients instead of fighting the EHR.

## 2. Ethics Overview

Key ethical concerns:

- **Privacy & confidentiality:** Patient data must be protected and access-controlled.
- **Security:** All queries and retrieved records should be encrypted and logged.
- **Transparency:** Users should know where each piece of information came from and when it was last updated.
- **Human control:** Clinicians remain fully responsible for decisions; the tool only surfaces information.
- **Reliability:** The system must fail safely (e.g., “no result found”) rather than hallucinate content.

## 3. Ethical Use Statement

MedQuery AI is designed as a **clinical information assistant**, not a diagnostic or decision-making system.  
It may only be used by **authorized healthcare staff** on secure, approved devices connected to the official EHR.

- AI outputs (retrieved reports and summaries) are **supporting information** and must always be checked against the original records.
- No diagnosis, treatment decision, or prescription should be based solely on MedQuery AI’s responses.
- All queries and accesses will be logged so that inappropriate use can be audited.
- The system will be configured to respect role-based access so users can only see records they are permitted to view.

By following these principles, MedQuery AI aims to improve clinician workflow while respecting patient rights, privacy, and safety.
